      We want your candles to give you joy and light while filling your space
      with beautiful aromatic notes that inspire love, creativity and
      relaxation. For the most effective way to do this, please follow our
      candle ca re tips below.

        When lighting for the first time burn until wax melts across entire
        surface to the sides of vessel (this prevents tunneling, and creates an
        even burn for the duration of the candle’s ‘life’) This may take up to
        2-4 hours.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Trim wick to ¼ of an inch before each burn to promote an even burn,
        steady flame and limit sooting/mushrooming of wick.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        To preserve the fragrance, do not burn your candle more than 4 hours at
        a time.
      </li>
      <li class="cared__item">
        Trim the candle wick after each burn. This is very important to prevent
        the candles from smoking on the next burn or from burning the sides of
        the glass. We recommend trimming them to 1/4th to 1/8th of an inch each
        time. Invest in a good pair of wick trimmers that will cut and remove
        the excess wick cleanly.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        If soot ever forms on the inside of the vessel, extinguish candle, wait
        for it to cool, then wipe with a clean damp cloth. Trim wick and
        relight.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Please keep the wax pool free of wick trimmings, matches and debris at
        all times.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Extinguish candle with a snuffer, or dip wick into melted wax and then
        straighten wick to prevent smoking and also prevent hot wax from
        splattering. Do not blow out.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Extinguish a candle if it smokes, flickers, or the flame becomes too
        high. These signs indicate the candle is not burning properly and the
        flame isn't controlled. Let the candle cool, trim the wick, then check
        for drafts before re-lighting.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        To maximize scent throw, burn in desired space for 30 mins with the door
        closed. Open windows and doors will disperse scent.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Always store your candles in a cool, dark and dry place. Avoid placing
        your candles where they will be directly exposed to sunlight or harsh
        indoor lighting.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Remove dust and fingerprints from a candle by gently rubbing the surface
        with a piece of nylon or a soft cloth. The cloth can be dry or slightly
        dampened with water.
      </li>
      <li class="card__item">
        Do not burn your candle all the way down. Always leave at least ½ inch
        of non-molten wax at the bottom.
